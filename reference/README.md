# Reference Implementations

These files represent the original working implementations before the Rust core (platlab_core) was introduced.

They are kept for behavioral reference only.

- js_sandbox/index.html → original browser sandbox physics
- pygame_sandbox/tuner.py → original pygame sandbox physics

IMPORTANT:
The authoritative simulation logic now lives in `crates/core`.
Do not modify these files unless intentionally comparing behavior.
